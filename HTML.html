<h3>BEEP. The whistle is blown. This year, the arena has mountains to the south, a lake to the east, a field of wheat to the west, and a forest and a clearing to the north. A river runs from the lake through the forest and the field to another small lake in the mountains. You consider this as you grab stuff from the cornucopia. You can only carry two things in your hands, and one bag on your back. You could put more things in your bag, but it would take 10 more seconds per item. Each item you grab will take 10 seconds to get to. You are at the entrance of the cornucopia, which is a bloodbath at the moment because the district one kids are coming from the back and fighting with everyone. They will reach you in about 10 seconds. There are backpacks, that contain 2 granola bars, an apple, and a canteen of water, and can hold two more items. There are blankets, which would be useful if you are going to the mountains. There are bundles with food and weapons. There are bows with arrows, extra arrows, a sword, an axe, a dagger, a swiss army knife, and two coils of rope. What do you grab? Remember that you only have 10 seconds, so you would only be able to grab three things before you have to get out of the cornucopia.</h3>
