<h3>BEEP. The whistle is blown. This year, the arena has mountains to the south, a lake to the east, a field of wheat to the west, and a forest and a clearing to the north. A river runs from the lake through the forest and the field to another small lake in the mountains. You consider this as you grab stuff from the cornucopia. You can only carry two things in your hands, and one bag on your back. You could put more things in your bag, but it would take 10 more seconds per item. Each item you grab will take 10 seconds to get to. You are at the entrance of the cornucopia, which is a bloodbath at the moment because the district one kids are coming from the back and fighting with everyone. They will reach you in about 10 seconds. You have enough time to grab, a.) A swiss army knife, dagger, and a backpack (3 days of food, canteen half-filled with water, and a single matchstick), b.) A bow and arrow, swiss army knife, and a backpack (3 days of food, canteen half-filled with water, and a single matchstick), c.) A coil of sturdy rope, a blanket (in case it gets cold), and a backpack (3 days of food, canteen half-filled with water, and a single matchstick), or d.) A kingly jewelled sword, a heavy axe (who knows? maybe you can copy Haymitch's style), and a blanket. Choose one, and fast. </h3>

<h3>You grab your supplies and run as fast as you can to a random tree that you spot to get away from the Careers. Luckily, they stop chasing you. However, it starts getting dark, and you need to choose your camping spot. You can camp a.) in the field of tall grass, b.) in the tree (in the forest), c.) in some shrubs by the lake, or d.) in an open field.</h3>

<h3> The next day, you go for a walk, and stumble across from a lake. You a.) and c.) fill your canteen from your backpack with the water, who knows whether it's good to drink? b.) You are doubtful about drinking it, so you fill your canteen with it, and stay the rest of the day in the shrubs to watch for anyone who will do the taste test for you. d.) Drink up! You don't know when there will be water again.</h3>

<h3>You and Tribute 5 are the last ones left. Suddenly, a bunch of poisonous monkeys with poisonous spit come hurtling out of the trees. You both run for the nearest tree, and you climb up as fast as you can. The other tribute isn't doing so well. The ten year old looks at you with tears streaming down her face. "Help me up. Please," she sobs. You are heartbroken, and you a.) Hold a knife to her throat as you hoist her up, b.) Pretend not to hear her and shoot at one of the many monkeys on the ground, c.) Help her up. You don't want to sacrifice her life, so you plan to finish your duel later, d.) Toss your weapon at the monkey charging for her, and help her up.</h3>
